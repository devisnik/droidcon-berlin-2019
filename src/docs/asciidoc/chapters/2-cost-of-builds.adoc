== The Cost of Builds

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Why do we even care about build performance?
--

=== Fast builds matter

30 seconds waste * 50 builds * 10 developers

+>+ 4 hours wasted time per day

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Just do the math!
* ...not even considering lost focus
* When the build is slow:
** people start building less (work in larger increments instead), getting less early feedback,
** issues arise late
** more failure on CI.
--

//=== What's a modern build
//* reliable / reproducible
//* customizable
//* universal
//* self-contained
//* fast, smart
//* maintainable
//
//[NOTE.speaker]
//--
//* not flaky, succeeds or fails repeatedly
//* handles specific requirements
//* runs from IDE, commandline and on CI
//* minimal dependencies, easy to set up and get started
//* performant
//* does not do work unnecessarily
//* easy to understand and extend

=== Build engineer

* monitors build
* ensures build health
* fixes regressions

answers questions like:

* How many builds are run locally and on CI?
* How often do they fail? And for which reasons?
* What are the longest-running tasks?
* Which tasks are run most often?
* Has our build become slower/faster lately?
* By how much?
* Which parts are affected?
* Which tests are slow? Which are flaky?

=== Build engineering
[quote, "Hans Dockter, Founder and CEO of Gradle Inc."]
____
In a healthy culture, developers and engineering leaders understand that the domain
of *building and integrating* software is just as *complex and challenging* as the domain
of application development.
