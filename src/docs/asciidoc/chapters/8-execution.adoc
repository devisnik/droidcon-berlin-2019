=== Execution
Executing selected tasks

* Incremental
* Cacheable
* Parallelizable

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Gradle run the requested task or tasks.

Example: `gradle clean`, `gradle assembleDebug`

includes AndroidStudio-Sync, Android Studio uses Gradle under the hood

To do so, it needs to run all the tasks it transitively depends on.

Gradle makes task execution faster:

* by running task incrementally
* caching task outputs
* running tasks in parallel

You want the execution to be incremental, highly cacheable, and parallelized.

So let's look into each of these properties.
--

=== Incrementality

Nothing changed and outputs still there?
 +
Executed tasks should be zero!

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Gradle can run tasks incrementally.

If the inputs of a tasks have not changed, and the outputs are still available
(because the task has been run before), the task does not need to run again.

Example: compilation does not need to be re-run if the source code hasn't changed.

Incrementality is something a task *opts into* by defining its inputs and outputs.
--

=== Non-incremental task

image::not-up-to-date-4.png[non-incremental task, 1100, *]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Here we see an example of a task that does not support incrementality.

We run `assembleDebug` twice, everything is reported as up-to-date, but still the task
executes again.

Happens because the task *does not produce output*, but rather prints into the console.

* no output, no incrementality
* more often: changing inputs, like timestamps, version counters, git commit sha etc.
--

=== Changing task input

image::changing-input-2.png[changing input, 1100, *]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Here is another task that re-runs on each execution.

We see that a property `timestamp` has changed.

If an input changes with each Gradle run, that completely destroys incrementality.

Fabrics is doing something similar, generating a unique build Id for every build.

If you're a Fabrics user, make sure to disable that feature for your debug builds.

=== Faster Compilation

* Modularization => Compile avoidance
* Decoupled code => Faster incremental compilation
* careful with annotation processing

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Gradle provides ways to make compilation faster.

Concept of "Compile Avoidance"

* if project A depends on project B and an implementation detail in B is changed
without affecting B's public interface, A does not need to be recompiled
* Modularization enables compile avoidance
** does not work for kotlin yet: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-24203

Concept of "incremental compilation"

* only compiles changed code and the code that depends on it
* Suppose class A extends from class B and not other code depends on B.
If we change B, only A get re-compiled.

Annotation processing

A regular annotation processor is some piece of code that gets run by the compiler.
It could do anything, it might even format your hard-drive.

So it has to be *run on any code change*.

If you need to use an annotation processor limit its usage to a sub-project if possible.

For instance, define your room entities in a separate module and apply
the room annotation-processor only in there.
--

=== Incremental Annotation processing

* since Gradle 4.7
* processors need to opt-in
* `kapt.incremental.apt = true` since kotlin 1.3.30

https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:incremental_annotation_processing
--

[NOTE.speaker]
--
To address the problem of broken incremental compilation due to annotation processing
Gradle came up with a simple set of rules for processors to follow to enable incrementality.

Each annotation processor need to explicitly declared that is follows those rules.

For many annotation processors it has to be explicitly enabled!

If any of the annotation processors in a project is not incremental,
incremental compilation is disabled!

When you run annotation processing through KAPT, incremental processing needs to be opted into.
It also is only support starting from kotlin 1.3.30. You pot-in by specifying the
listed property in your `gradle.properties` file.

Given link to docs contains a list of popular annotation processors and
the state of them supporting incremental annotation processing.

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
javaCompileOptions {
  annotationProcessorOptions {
    arguments << ["dagger.gradle.incremental": "true"]
  }
}
----

inside `android.defaultConfig`

=== Cacheability

Task has been run with same inputs before?
 +
Pull its outputs from cache

`org.gradle.caching = true`

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Extension on incrementality, handling the case that where the outputs have been deleted,
but can be recreated from cache entry.

Local build cache is handy *when switching between branches*.

Outputs get overridden but can be recreated from the local cache.

Tasks need to *opt-in* into this mechanism.
--

=== Local cache utilization

image::build-cache-performance.png[build cache performance, 1100, *]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
A scan after running `clean assembleDebug` twice.

Outputs are fully pulled from cache.

Remember: Caching needs to be enabled via `org.gradle.cache=true`, or running with `--build-cache`.
--

=== Local cache utilization

Many tasks are cacheable

[NOTE.speaker]
--
More to come with every Android Gradle plugin update.

For example: java unit test execution is already cached for java modules.
Coming for Android modules soon.

If nothing has changed in a module or the modules it depends on, why re-run the tests?

For some tasks, caching does not make sense:
For example: Jar task is not cached, it's faster to re-execute than to pull from cache and extract again.
--

=== Remote cache

image::build-cache.png[remote cache setup, 600, *]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Local caching is nice, but you actually what remote caching.

A remote cache is a cache shared within your team or organization.

Cache gets populated from CI builds, developers only read from it.

Can be used side-by side with a local build cache.

Now everything that has been build on CI becomes available from the cache!

Tremendous speed-ups in development.

Scenario:

* the long first build after pulling in the morning
* CI has build it before, lot's of task outputs can be pulled off the remote cache.
--

=== Remote Cache Misses

* input hash changes across environments
* due to non-portable inputs

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Maintaining a high cache hit rate is still some effort.

There have been quite some tasks in the Android Gradle plugins
that broke cacheability

But bugs get fixed with every new release of the Android Gradle plugin,
so staying up to date is important.
--

=== Parallelism

* `org.gradle.parallel = true` or `--parallel`
* for decoupled modules

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Off by default, should be safe in almost all cases.

Works best with many small, decoupled modules.

There is no in-project parallelity.

Gradle has separate APIs for in-project parallel execution that plugins can use.
