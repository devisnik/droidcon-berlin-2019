== Build Lifecycle

Once our measurements and profiling is done, we need good way to *visualize*
what has actually happened in the profiled build.

And the best tool for that job is *Build Scans*.

=== Build Scans

Who has used build scans before?

Who uses it regularly?

How does it work? Just add `--scan` and your provided with a link to scan at the end of the build.

* free service provided by Gradle Inc.

* shareable, persistent record of a build
* provides insights into what happened and why
* user-friendly and insightful
* completely free

* supports Gradle and Maven builds
* deep links to any of the details
* to be shared with your colleagues
* only accessible via a randomly generated link

Google loves these build scans too.

=== Build Lifecycle

Here we look into the performance section of a build scan.

* detailed listing of how much time was spent in certain parts of the build

3 Phases

* initialization: startup, run buildSrc project, read settings
* configuration: Gradle makes sense of your build
* execution: Gradle runs the requested tasks (and all the tasks that need to run before them)

We'll look at each of these phases separately.

Gradle and Android Gradle plugin do lots of optimizations to keep the build fast.

But Gradle is also very flexible, and there are many opportunities to shoot yourself in the foot.

=== High GC time

Sometimes the problem is pretty easy to spot!

Here we see a build with a high time spent on garbage collection.

=== High GC time (fixed)

=== Red flags

* initialization > 1s
* long configuration
//* no-op build doing any work
* single line change `~=` clean build
* high gc time

[NOTE.speaker]

* Startup/Settings/buildSrc being slow
** daemon enabled? Healthy?
** dedicated section in the build scans
** might have a memory leak

* configuration
** dependent on your build
** previous scan configuration took 1.4 seconds, 20 sub-projects, 100.000 lines of code, mixed kotlin/java

* single line change
** Gradle supports incremental compilation
** should only re-build what has changed and their dependants

=== Logic during initialization

Don't do this!

[source,groovy]
----
// logic in settings.gradle
// brittle, can be slow!

new File('.').eachFileRecurse(groovy.io.FileType.DIRECTORIES) { dir ->
    if (new File(dir,"build.gradle").exists()) {
        def name = dir.toString()[1..-1].replaceAll('/',':')
        include name
    }}

Someone tried to be clever!

* code traverses the project file tree to find all subprojects automatically,
avoiding adding an `include` line for each new subproject

* this is *expensive*

* dependent on file system layout
* incurs hidden performance penalty
* clever, but brittle!
