== General Advice

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Before we start looking into specific findings, let me give some general advice.
--

=== Stay up-to-date

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 5.5`

https://services.gradle.org/versions/current

{sp}

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.4.1'
----

There is *performance improvements* and *bug fixes* coming with every new release.

Gradle releases every 6 to 8 weeks.

AGP is updated a bit less frequently.

=== Settings

`org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4G`

`org.gradle.daemon = true`

`org.gradle.caching = true`

`org.gradle.parallel = true`

jvmargs:

You might see some post on stack overflow advising "just past these 20 parameters into your jvmargs".
Don't do that!

* just provide enough heap space
* other tweaks often do harm,
* time is better spent on structural improvements

daemon:

* ON by default, Do not disable it!
* in-memory caches
* when building repeatedly
* builds get faster over time due to JIT and in-memory caching

If you need to disable the daemon for whatever reason, there is a problem in your build you need to fix.

At Gradle, we even run CI builds with enabled daemon.

You set those in `gradle.properties` in the root project

Settings for all your builds go into the `gradle.properties` of your GRADLE_HOME folder.

You probably want to enable caching and parallel builds as well.
We'll look into the details of those later.

//parallel:
//
//* OFF by default, usually safe to enable
//* speeds up multi-project builds
//
//caching:
//
//* caches locally by default
//* like "up-to-date" but between branches
//* can work with remote cache as well
//* older kotlin: usage by KAPT needs to be enabled

=== Repository content filtering

[source,groovy]
----
google() {
    content {
	    includeGroupByRegex "com\\.android\\..*"
	    includeGroupByRegex "com\\.google\\.android\\..*"
	    includeGroupByRegex "androidx\\..*"
    }
}

A lot of work at Gradle has gone into improving dependency management, lately.

There is a dedicated team working on that.

One of things added is *Repository content filter*.

Allows to specify which dependencies to expect from a repository.

Repositories are searched in the order they are defined, and usually `google()` has to be
defined first. (There was an issue with play services forcing that ordering.)

Great too for repositories that only provide a single or very few dependencies.
(jitpack, your custom repo, fabrics repo, ...)

Reasons:

* performance, when you know a dependency will never be found in a specific repository
* security, by avoiding leaking what dependencies are used in a private project
* reliability, when some repositories contain corrupted metadata or artifacts

Itâ€™s even more important when considering that order of repositories matter.
